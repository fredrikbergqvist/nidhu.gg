# Hello, I'm Fredrik

Father of two, resident of Stockholm, and employed as the senior front end developer at [MAG Interactive](https://maginteractive.com/), where he creates tools to aid in the work of game developers, data engineers, and other support personnel.

The main building blocks of the tools are React and Next.js, and Google Cloud Run is used to run them.

Although I have other interests, including gaming, I've always been captivated by the web and its potential because there's always something new to learn.

I've worked with a wide range of websites over the course of my nearly 25-year career, from government and municipal sites to banks and e-commerce, from informational sites to applications. Variety is the flavour of life, and I've always cherished discovering new industries and business practises.

The possibility of creating something that could be viewed and utilised by millions of people, and hopefully something that may ease their lives, has always drew me to working with the web.
